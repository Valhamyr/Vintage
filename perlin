# Perlin Noise Quick Reference

This document summarizes how to use Perlin noise parameters to replicate the landforms outlined in the Worldgen mod README. Understanding these values makes it easier to design new terrain types.

## Core Parameters

- **baseHeight**: Starting elevation for the landform. Combined with generated noise to determine final block height.
- **noiseScale**: Controls the horizontal size of noise features. Smaller values create larger, more spread out features, while larger values produce tighter variation.
- **threshold**: Minimum noise value required for this landform to appear at a point. Higher thresholds make the shape rarer and more isolated.
- **heightOffset**: Added after noise calculation to raise or lower the entire landform.
- **terrainOctaves**: Array of amplitude multipliers per octave. Higher entries add more detail at that octave. Set to `0` to disable an octave.
- **terrainOctaveThresholds**: Optional array of per-octave thresholds. Values near `1` remove most of that octave’s influence. Usually left at `0`.
- **terrainYKeyPositions**: Normalized vertical positions (0–1) describing important heights within the landform.
- **terrainYKeyThresholds**: Blending values for the Y key positions. When used with the helper script these shape plateaus, cliffs and other vertical transitions.
- **mutations**: Optional variations with their own octave/height settings. The `chance` field indicates how frequently the mutation appears.

The `generate_noise_images.py` script reads these fields from `worldgen/landforms.json` and previews the resulting maps.

## Example Landforms

From the README in `WorldgenMod`, five primary landforms are planned:

- **Flatlands** – nearly level terrain.
- **Sheer Cliffs** – tall vertical faces.
- **Canyons** – deep ravines with narrow paths.
- **Tower Cliffs** – isolated pillars rising from flat surroundings.
- **Multi-level Plateaus** (`riceplateaus`) – tiered shelves at several heights.

The table below lists representative parameter choices from `FixedCliffs/landforms.json` that influence these shapes.

| Code           | noiseScale | threshold | Example notes |
|---------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| `flatlands`    | `0.001`   | `0.5`    | Gentle height changes. Terrain octaves emphasize smooth slopes.
| `sheercliffs`  | `0.0005`  | `0.95`   | High threshold and strong octaves create abrupt walls.
| `canyons`      | `0.0005`  | `0.2`    | Tall plateaus with narrow low paths.
| `towercliffs`  | `0.0005`  | `0.97`   | Multiple octaves focus noise near the top to form pillars.
| `riceplateaus` | `0.0002`  | `0.4`    | Wide terraces forming large flat platforms.

Adjusting these values changes how often a landform appears and how dramatic its features look. Lower the threshold to spread a shape farther across the world. Increase specific octave amplitudes to add jagged details at different sizes.

For new terrain types, start with a base landform and tweak:

1. **noiseScale** to control overall feature size.
2. **terrainOctaves** to emphasize or suppress detail at each octave.
3. **terrainYKeyPositions/YKeyThresholds** to introduce plateaus, cliffs, or gentle slopes.
4. **mutations** for rare variations such as cavern openings or extra noise layers.

Using these settings in combination lets you create terrain that ranges from smooth plains to chaotic spires.
